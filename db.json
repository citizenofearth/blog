Mix","date":"2017-01-24T17:57:18.000Z","author":"Nyx Sygnal","_content":"## THUKKER TRIBE\n\nThe Thukker tribe is one of the seven original Minmatar tribes. After the Minmatar Rebellion the Thukkers left Minmatar space and took up the nomadic lifestyles of their ancestors, only this time in space. The closest thing they've got to home is the Great Wildlands region, where they are very numerous, but the Thukkers like to be on the move, constantly going from one solar system to another in their huge caravans, trading and scavenging. Respectable citizens of EVE frown upon the Thukkers, considering them to be nothing but scoundrels and thieves. Indeed, the Thukkers often operate on the shadier side of the law, but their resourcefulness and diligence count a lot more for their success than their criminal activities.\n\n## GOVERNMENT\n\nThukkers enjoy their independence which each doing what they wish. Besides the Thukker tribal leader Einnar Aeboul and other tribal authorities, the Thukkers are governed by the Great Caravans which are among the largest and greatest in the Thukker controlled Great Wildlands. Though constantly on the move, their influence within the Thukker Tribe is undeniable.\n\nCaravans are run by caravan masters, which are also Thukker tribal leaders, that coordinate fleet movements, oversee the maintenance of generations-old vessels, and engage in protracted commercial negotiations that impact the livelihood of their caravan, thus they take a very active role in the day-to-day administration of caravan affairs. Caravans maintain their own military forces to ensure the defense of their caravan, trade routes or space stations.\n\nAmong the Great Caravans are the Lakat-Hro and the Jabar, but the Lakat-Hro was lost in a wormhole. It has been suggested that the remnants will gather with Vo-Lakat, an off-shoot of the Lakat-Hro. Several other known caravans are the Sekyal, Hrada-Oki, Charcoal Embers, Fuldis and Fortune's Tally.\n\nThe recent reintegration of the tribe has presented several problems. Racial stigmas among the other tribes still linger about how Thukkers preferred mobility as their best defense to the Amarr occupation of their people and the great amount of distrust among fellow Minmatar. They also face problems with many planet-bound Thukkers that feel themselves increasingly estranged from the politics of their space-faring brethren and expressed concern that caravan masters no longer represent their needs.\n\n## MILITARY\n\nThe Thukker Tribe maintain their own ships in the defense of the tribe but individual caravans also maintain their own military forces. These forces are to maintain the defenses of the caravans, trade routes for travel or protection their space stations. Some of these forces were involved in the Elder War and in the raid on Konora.\n\n## CULTURE\n\nThukker culture is highly nomadic based on their ancestors constant traveling and trading caravans. Though a few stigmas have been found by the recent reintegration of the tribe, like many traditions developed and passed down by space-faring Thukkers are found to be difficult or nearly impossible on a planet. For years the Voluval ceremony was administered only in space with some extreme interpretations require the ritual to be performed in vac-suits. Planet-bound Thukkers feel they have an identity crisis of whether or not they are truly Thukker.\n\nRespectable citizens of New Eden frown upon the Thukkers, considering them to be nothing but scoundrels and thieves. Though the Thukkers often operate on the darker side of the law, their resourcefulness and diligence counts more for their success than their criminal activities.\n\n## HISTORY\n\nThe Thukker tribe are wanderers traveling from one place to the next being among caravans, traders and scavengers like their ancestors on Matar.\n\n# Ancient History\n\nThe Thukker Tribe are believed to have originated from the Mioaran islands according to recently archeological discoveries and oral histories from the Thukker Tribe which suggest they left the islands long before the arrival of the Brutor Tribe.\n\nWhen the Amarr Empire arrived the Thukkers preferred mobility as their best defense against the Amarr Empire but were eventually enslaved like many of their brethen. It wasn't until the Minmatar Rebellion that secured their freedom from the Empire.\n\nAfter the Minmtar Rebellion, the Thukkers declined to joined the Minmatar Republic and left Minmatar space where they took up the nomadic life of their ancestors, only in space.

After the Minmatar Rebellion the Thukkers left Minmatar space and took up the nomadic lifestyles of their ancestors, only this time in space. The closest thing they've got to home is the Great Wildlands region, where they are very numerous, but the Thukkers like to be on the move, constantly going from one solar system to another in their huge caravans, trading and scavenging. Respectable citizens of EVE frown upon the Thukkers, considering them to be nothing but scoundrels and thieves. Indeed, the Thukkers often operate on the shadier side of the law, but their resourcefulness and diligence count a lot more for their success than their criminal activities.\n\n## GOVERNMENT\n\nThukkers enjoy their independence which each doing what they wish. Besides the Thukker tribal leader Einnar Aeboul and other tribal authorities, the Thukkers are governed by the Great Caravans which are among the largest and greatest in the Thukker controlled Great Wildlands. Though constantly on the move, their influence within the Thukker Tribe is undeniable.\n\nCaravans are run by caravan masters, which are also Thukker tribal leaders, that coordinate fleet movements, oversee the maintenance of generations-old vessels, and engage in protracted commercial negotiations that impact the livelihood of their caravan, thus they take a very active role in the day-to-day administration of caravan affairs. Caravans maintain their own military forces to ensure the defense of their caravan, trade routes or space stations.\n\nAmong the Great Caravans are the Lakat-Hro and the Jabar, but the Lakat-Hro was lost in a wormhole. It has been suggested that the remnants will gather with Vo-Lakat, an off-shoot of the Lakat-Hro. Several other known caravans are the Sekyal, Hrada-Oki, Charcoal Embers, Fuldis and Fortune's Tally.\n\nThe recent reintegration of the tribe has presented several problems. Racial stigmas among the other tribes still linger about how Thukkers preferred mobility as their best defense to the Amarr occupation of their people and the great amount of distrust among fellow Minmatar. They also face problems with many planet-bound Thukkers that feel themselves increasingly estranged from the politics of their space-faring brethren and expressed concern that caravan masters no longer represent their needs.\n\n## MILITARY\n\nThe Thukker Tribe maintain their own ships in the defense of the tribe but individual caravans also maintain their own military forces. These forces are to maintain the defenses of the caravans, trade routes for travel or protection their space stations. Some of these forces were involved in the Elder War and in the raid on Konora.\n\n## CULTURE\n\nThukker culture is highly nomadic based on their ancestors constant traveling and trading caravans. Though a few stigmas have been found by the recent reintegration of the tribe, like many traditions developed and passed down by space-faring Thukkers are found to be difficult or nearly impossible on a planet. For years the Voluval ceremony was administered only in space with some extreme interpretations require the ritual to be performed in vac-suits. Planet-bound Thukkers feel they have an identity crisis of whether or not they are truly Thukker.\n\nRespectable citizens of New Eden frown upon the Thukkers, considering them to be nothing but scoundrels and thieves. Though the Thukkers often operate on the darker side of the law, their resourcefulness and diligence counts more for their success than their criminal activities.\n\n## HISTORY\n\nThe Thukker tribe are wanderers traveling from one place to the next being among caravans, traders and scavengers like their ancestors on Matar.\n\n# Ancient History\n\nThe Thukker Tribe are believed to have originated from the Mioaran islands according to recently archeological discoveries and oral histories from the Thukker Tribe which suggest they left the islands long before the arrival of the Brutor Tribe.\n\nWhen the Amarr Empire arrived the Thukkers preferred mobility as their best defense against the Amarr Empire but were eventually enslaved like many of their brethen. It wasn't until the Minmatar Rebellion that secured their freedom from the Empire.\n\nAfter the Minmtar Rebellion, the Thukkers declined to joined the Minmatar Republic and left Minmatar space where they took up the nomadic life of their ancestors, only in space. The closest thing they've got to home is the Great Wildlands region, where they are very numerous, but the Thukkers like to be on the move, constantly going from one solar system to another in their huge caravans, trading and scavenging.\n\n# Elder War\n\nThe Thukkers were secretly involved in the construction of the Minmatar Elder Fleet and contributed forces to the Elder task forces.
