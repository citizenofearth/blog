## WORMHOLES

```
Wormholes, introduced in the [Apocrypha](https://community.eveonline.com/news/patch-notes/patch-notes-for-apocrypha-1) expansion, are rifts in space that connect two star systems. Like stargates, they allow ships to travel from one star system to another, but unlike stargates, wormholes are not permanent. They connect two systems for only a short time and collapse when either their lifespan ends or too many ships have passed through them. Wormholes can connect any two systems regardless of distance from each other, providing temporary shortcuts to areas that would otherwise take many jumps to reach. Wormholes can also connect to uncharted space, or the Anoikis galaxy (henceforth referred to as Wormhole Space or W-Space); these systems are uncharted, and do not operate like normal systems.

In the [Rhea](https://community.eveonline.com/news/patch-notes/patch-notes-for-rhea) expansion, new types of wormholes were introduced - the massive wormhole system with stations (Thera) and Shattered Wormholes, mysterious regions of space which cannot host any residents. Recently the Drifters have appeared, and with them five Drifter wormhole systems that are marked from known space with a "unidentified wormhole" beacon.
