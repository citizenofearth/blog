We are the [Blood of the Khan](https://eve.tenzin.ca/), a nomadic tribe of New Eden.  For æons, since the Great Khagan Temüjin founded the empire, his blood, our anscestors, roamed and conquered the earth.  We, the lost children of Temüjin, have now taken to the stars to paint the skies in red giant blood.
