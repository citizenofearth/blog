_Part 1: {% post_link location-hunting Location Hunting %}_

### Lessons:

- Look at 24 hour NPC kills and 24 hour jump statistics to determine how busy the star system is

- Consider Sansha Incursion space as completely hostile, even in high security space

- The 0.5 moon mining system does not need to be next door to a good ice mining system you are already settled in


### Locations:

- Garisas in Kador is a very busy and developed pocket

- Pulin has had some significant ganking activity recently

- Rohamaa is also a very busy and developed pocket

- Ebo has very low NPC kill and jump activity -> will investigate further
