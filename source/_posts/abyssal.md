### Strategy

Enter the site and take an Overclocker III (only needed in L5). Manual pilot to establish transversal on the targets and use drones to eliminate them in the order of anything webbing you -> cruiser -> battleship -> frigate.  Try to angle yourself to bioadaptive caches early in the site, scoop them, then orbit the conduit at 20km until the site’s cleared.  Repair modules that you overheated before entering the next room.  If you encounter a swarm of small enemies with an area-denial (point defense) pylon in the room, burn to the pylon (they’ll follow you and die), while sending your drones on something out of the pylon’s range.

Vespas are the best type of drone for all abyssal sites.  Everything has either omni-resist or a kinetic hole.

Protip: overheat your RLMLs, then rep them while they reload.

HG crystals are MANDATORY in L5 (chaotic) sites.  You WILL die if you don’t have them.  You can get away with no High-Grades in a L4 site, or with Mid-Grades if you want to be safer (you can also downgrade to a B-Type Invuln and Republic Fleet Cap Battery if you want to run L4s only, but I highly recommend the A-Type for L5; most of our testing losses had btypes).

Feel free to round out the capacitor stability with an Antipharmakon Aeolis, or an 803 cap implant if you aren’t using a Zor’s.  You don’t actually need to (you’re never going to run everything with heat for 10 minutes), but it makes it more comfortable.  An Aeolis + EM-804 is mandatory if you don’t have perfect cap skills.

A note on augmented drones: You can push out a little more DPS by using aug vespas.  I don’t recommend it because you tend to lose drones a lot, but I sometimes carry 1 set of aug vespas and recall them for T2s if they start taking heavy damage.

Make sure to keep an eye on your capacitor (they’re stable with max skills, but not without max; use an aeolis to fix this). Also, feel free to upgrade your mods (especially propmods) with Abyssal gear; in particular, if you can get a maxed fitting prop mod onto the Gila, you can also swap out for an Republic Fleet Cap Battery and save some isk on the Thurifier (current Gila has an all-green Abyssal 10MN I mutated out of a Shadow Serpentis AB).

Estimated clear times: L4s 10 minutes, L5s 15-17 minutes.
