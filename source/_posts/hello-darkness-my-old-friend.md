![World of Warcraft](/images/wow.png)

Out with the old and in with the even older.  My original MMORPG addiction from 2004 is back with a vengeance.  After playing intensely in the original vanilla release (over 150 days of /played time in 2 years), I just as swiftly quit after the first expansion pack (The Burning Crusade) arrived, making my hard-earned epic and legendary gear obsolete within minutes after the first few pieces of green BoE gear dropped in Outland.  This was quite disheartening, but here we are again in 2019, trading one addiction (EVE) for another.  The current state of WoW seems ripe for me to come back.  After just a week of playing, I am back with a Night Elf Rogue at level 69.  Dreams of unlocking new races, trying out all the content I missed over the last 15 years, enjoying PvP battlegrounds, and large-scale raids are all rushing back to me.  And the vision that was planted in my brain, still remains...
